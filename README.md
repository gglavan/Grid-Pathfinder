# Grid-Pathfinder 

A grid pathfinding web app based on the 2 well-known minimum path algorithms, A* and Dijkstra. The application is aimed to give a great visualisation and comparison between them in different situations.  

#### Features:
* picking the desired start and finish spots  
* generating random obstacles on the grid    
* drawing obstacles with the mouse    
* saving the grid structure  
* opening a grid structure  
* transforming black & white images into grid obstacles  
* switching between algorithms at any moment
* live visualisation of the searching process  
* information about every search
